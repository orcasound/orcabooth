# orcabooth

Content and how-to for an ocean listening exhibit. First deployed at the Langley Whale Center (in Langley, WA, USA) within an antique telephone booth, the content includes recordings of local underwater sounds that play when the user selects an object within an imagemap (panoramic seascape art). The hardware included a Raspberry Pi and a touch screen, while the software leaveraged a kiosk version of the Chromium browser.
